# hello-world
The company will create a search engine for products available to Icelanders. A similar platform is available around the world in forms of websites like www.pricerunner.com and www.prisjakt.se. Through the search engine, customers would be able to get up to date prices, stock information and information about in what stores the product they are looking for it is available. If you want to buy new running shoes and you know the type you need, you can just search for "Nike Lunarglide 7" etc. The search engine will look for the product and give you information about where the product is available and what store has the best price (with and without delivery cost). If you are not sure what kind of running shoes you need, the website will also display reviews of relevant products and reviews of the store you intend to buy from. Furthermore, you can sign up and follow the price development and get a notification when the product drops in price.
